A general repository holding all of my test files and other junk I'm messing around with. Likely has a bunch of files and folders with the word "test" in their names.

I don't know why anyone would clone this, but if you do, expect folders with dead-ends and files that are pretty much empty, contradict themselves, or just don't work scattered about.
